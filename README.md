# k_means

In unsupervised machine learning, clustering is a primary method for finding the structure and patterns within unlabelled data.K-Means clustering methods are widely used due to being simple to implement, having fast execution time, and producing easily interpretable outputs/results. However, K-Means has two major downsides: the way initial centroids are selected and the way K is chosen. If the initial centroid selections or K values are not appropriate, this can lead to poor quality/solutions produced by K-Means.
This report will provide a complete tutorial of how K-Means works and then examine the initialisation and K values that impact the way K-Means operates. We will use Python to demonstrate the centroids' movement and demonstrate the difference between random initialisation and K-Means++, and to show the results of applying both the Elbow method and Silhouette score to determine the appropriate value for K. Additionally, we will cover a case study of K-Means performing poorly with a non-spherical dataset and briefly explain when to use K-Means and when not to use it. The report will combine theoretical explanations of clustering algorithms with practical demonstrations of how clustering is achieved and searching for clustering solutions will demonstrate many of the generic methods and models used in machine learning, including distance metrics, iterative optimisation, and clustering by centroids.
